                            <p>
                                 I have worked, on multiple occasions, with Temkin for the past two years. During this time, Temkin proved himself to be a hard worker with solid problem solving
                                and technical skills. I was always impressed by Temkin's ability to complete the work assigned to him on time. Temkin not only met deadlines but also explains his programs in a way that non-experts can easily understand.
                                Temkin takes his work very seriously and regularly enrolled in classes to stay abreast of the newest developments in programming. He also travels to multiple conferences for this purpose every year. His ongoing professional
                                development courses and trips helped him to easily learn new techniques and perform complex tasks the first time around. Although Temkin is a fast-learner, he is very careful and cautious about his work. That means
                                he repeatedly runs checks on his programs (and others) before making them public to ensure there aren't any hiccups. His quick thinking and cautious personality has helped the company avoid some costly and embarrassing
                                mistakes. Overall, Temkin is a talented, hard-working programmer. I strongly recommend Temkin for any mid-level development position. And with the right guidance and training, I have no doubt Temkin could excel in an
                                upper-level development position. He's simply that good. Sincerely, Elias Amha

                                Temkin is a generous and courageous person who takes a matter from anyone in what he believes, also he is a gifted person who tries to uphold a light being undistinguished

                                 And here I'm honoured to recommend Mr @Temikin Mengistu (chapi) who is a person of value , a great mentor and a man who knows what he is doing. It all started at Adama Science and Technology University inside our computer science and engineering club (CSEC_ASTU) . During our stay there , I've observed that chapi posses great technical skills on python, competitive programming, bot development, Django framework, back-end development ... etc . 

                                It is not just that technical skills that impress me,But also chapi was a joy to work with because of his positive attitudes , his eagerness to invest on others , his abilities to give direct and honest feedback (I really love when my projects are judged by him üòç) and his respectful attitudes were also valued not just myself and also my peers .while we are chatting together we used to call him boss üòé which he doesn't know about till the present day. chapi is a person whom you can easily get jealous of , He is happy all the time ,maintains his social life and he works till he get the best out of his job . 
                                
                                Whomever is trying to work with chapi . I am absolutely confident he would be a great fit not only will he bring the kind of skills and experience you are looking for , but also will become an asset and help you and your work grow in any way he can ... This is the least I can say about chapi , Thank you brother for everything üôèüôèüôè wish you a success wherever you go .let Allah be with you ...
